# Receipe App.

The Recipe app keeps track of all your recipes, ingredients and inventory. It will let you save ingredients, keep track of what you have, create recipes, and generate a shopping list based on what you have and what's missing from a recipe. Also, since sharing recipes is an important part of cooking, the app can let you make them public so anyone can access them.
